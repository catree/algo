You don't want to use this code. 

I've been reading Steven Skiena's [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com) lately,
to refresh my long-dormant knowledge of fundamental data structures and algorithms. I decided to start
implementing a few of the things discussed in the book as a C90 single-header-file library (cribbing
heavily from the gospel of [stblib](https://github.com/nothings/stb)). I'm sure every aspiring programmer
in the world has already written this code; many of them probably did a better job than I have.
If you're looking for quality code, I recommend using theirs instead.

Currently includes:
- stack
- queue
- heap / priority queue
- pool allocator

On deck:
- hash table
- graph
