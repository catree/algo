You don't want to use this code. 

I've been reading Steven Skiena's [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com) lately,
to refresh my long-dormant knowledge of fundamental data structures and algorithms. I decided to start
implementing a few of the algorithm discussed in the book, using whatever subset of C99 is supported
by Visual Studio 2013. I'm sure every computer science student in the world has written these things;
many of them probably did a better job than I have. If you're looking for quality code, I recommend
using theirs instead.
